                <p>
                    Founded by Mahatma Gandhi in the memory of his wife,
Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Trust [KGNMT] is one
of the oldest pre‐independence, non‐governmental
institutions serving the needy women and children of rural
India.
The foundation of the Trust is based on the concept of
service and the Kasturba Trust is resolved to continue with
its tradition of constructive <span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more"> work for the needy, under
privileged sections and the last individual in the society.
The Trust also extends its work to those who are victims of
terrorism and violence. Issues such as child malnutrition,
female health continue to need attention. Issues such as
sex determination promoted by son preference and Child
Trafficking have become dramatic realities, and are a
special challenge for the Trust.
The historic institution of Kasturba Gandhi National
Memorial Trust is a MOVEMENT. For the Trust to meet its
challenges, we will have to work towards those aims. Some
broad areas which need our constant attention are :
Maintenance and restoration of old and damaged
buildings, the salary of the staff, travel of our workers,
running and maintenance of nurseries and creches are
certainly among the unavoidable areas of our expenses.
Serious thought and implementation have to be considered
to pay good salary to our staff and dedicated workers in
today's context. We will also need more salaried and
dedicated workers. We have huge tracts of land all over the
country. We need to put them to the right use. This
Movement should also reach out to be of service and help
in friendship, in the so far unexplored areas of the country.
The focal points of the Trust “Ba Ka Ghar” and “Shanti Sena”
contain all the dimensions of the activities of the Trust in
the vision of Sarvodaya – The reawakening of the spirit in
harmony with nature and all life. APPEAL FOR DONATIONS
“Ba Ka Ghar” means the rehabilitation, and giving moral
support and vocational training to women victims of social
injustice.
The concept of “Shanti Sena” is the physical, mental and
spiritual discipline of the fearlessness of Gandhi – it is to
learn the way of non‐violent protest against any form of
injustice, as well as to be able to work for protection and
rehabilitation against natural calamities.”
The Movement of Kasturba Gandhi Memorial Trust needs
your help to keep the momentum of service alive in the
historic institution Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial
Trust.
We will always be grateful for any small or big financial help
that any individual, institution or society can give to us. You
can mark your donation for a specific cause that you would
desire. </span>
